# Contributing to Code Review Application

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Code Review Application as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Requests

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if appropriate
2. Update the documentation with details of any new functionality 
3. The PR should work for Java 21 or later
4. Ensure all tests pass

## Code Style

- Follow standard Java code conventions
- Use descriptive variable and method names
- Document public methods with JavaDoc comments
- Write unit tests for new functionality

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/code-review/issues/new); it's that easy!
